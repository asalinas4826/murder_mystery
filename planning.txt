text-scroll

- PROBLEM: display NPC text at bottom of screen, with
	scrolling and write it to the screen one word at a time.
	Also, the player must be able to select entire sentences 
	with the mouse and save them into a list of witness 
	statements.

- SOLUTION: parse the textbox into a list of sentences,
	separating by '.'. Fill the textbox GUI w/ as many sentences as possible, and use MeasureText() to generate bounding
	boxes for the sentences. When clicked, the sentence will be
	saved into a witness statements list. Press return to load
	next couple of sentences.

- IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: each sentence will have a max of 2
	bounding boxes for case where a sentence wraps the line.
