Core idea
- early 20th century murder mystery
- you're in either a mansion or remote village
	- and you get snowed in
- murder happens, you have to solve it yourself
- similar in style to ROTOD and COTGI, where the
	game doesn't clue you in or help you
	- player should FEEL like a detective
	- AGENCY
- question witnesses and gather environmental 
	evidence

Graphical style
- black, white, red for blood
- pixel art, cartoonish

Mechanics
- no inventory, no clue system
- just a notepad, and anything can be a clue
- basically walk around and talk to people
	and look around in rooms and draw your own
	conclusions
- "presenting evidence":
	- take a statement from a witness and present it
	  against a statement from another witness
	- this will be the main form of progression
	- evidence can also be taken from the environment
		- point-and-click
		- examine an object and a descriptive sentence
			will be written to the textbox
		- present against witness statements in the same
			way

Ideas
- idea: what if you weren't told if your
	accusations are correct?
- idea: play as a priest
	- Confession could be a hint system
		- people would reveal things to you that they
			normally wouldn't, but they're behind a screen
		- can't use info gained in confession anywhere
			else

UI
- textbox at bottom
- ESC for settings
- notepad on right
- evidence tab pops up with TAB

Todos
- QOL: better note-taking
	- scale textbox char width w/ screen size
	- better backspace for note-taking
	- cursor during note-taking
	- find good font
- CORE: make an interactable room
	- objects can be clicked on and show text
	- NPC you can talk to
