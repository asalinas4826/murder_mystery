Core idea:
- early 20th century murder mystery
- you're in either a mansion or remote village
	- and you get snowed in
- murder happens, you have to solve it yourself
- similar in style to ROTOD and COTGI, where the
	game doesn't clue you in or help you
	- player should FEEL like a detective
	- AGENCY

Graphical style:
- black, white, red for blood
- pixel art, cartoonish

Mechanics:
- no inventory, no clue system
- just a notepad, and anything can be a clue
- basically walk around and talk to people
	and look around in rooms and draw your own
	conclusions
- idea: what if you weren't told if your
	accusations are correct?
- "presenting evidence":
	- take a statement from a witness and present it
	  against a statement from another witness
	- this will be the main form of progression

UI:
- textbox at bottom
- ESC for settings
- notepad on right
- evidence tab pops up with TAB
